        <p className="leading-relaxed">
          Airfares can change minute by minute depending on demand and availability. Between the time of your flight search and the time of your original reservation, seat inventory in a given booking class (fare) may sell out. The available seats are subsequently sold at a greater price by the airlines. FLYEZ regularly monitors these changes and makes every attempt to keep inventory and fares as updated as possible in the listings.

          <p className="leading-relaxed">
            When you book with FLYEZ, we want you to be confident that you have found an excellent deal. As a result, if you find a lower price (including taxes and fees) for the same flight itinerary available for booking on a Major OTA Competitor's site on the same day of the booking up to 10 p.m., we will match that lower price by refunding the price difference, or you may cancel your reservation with us for a full refund.
          </p>
          <p className="leading-relaxed">
            The phrase <strong>"same itinerary"</strong> refers to the fact that all of the elements of each offer match, including the airline(s), flight number(s), route, date(s), number of people, and seat type.

          FLYEZ provides a variety of special discounts and promotions, including military discounts. Because most airlines provide lower airfare for Military-ID cards or active duty people, you can choose these tickets to save money.

          Adults over the age of 65 may be eligible for senior citizen discounts, although this is dependent on the policies of the airlines.

          Consolidator fares are typically 20-50% less expensive than published fares, and they may be subject to comparable or additional limitations.

          Some airlines no longer provide or charge for in-flight meals. However, you have the option of requesting a special meal while purchasing tickets online, or by calling the airline directly.

          Infants under the age of 24 months traveling within the United States travel free as long as they are seated on the lap of an adult (over the age of 18).

          All reservations must be made using the precise and original name of the person travelling; no nicknames are permitted. The name specified at the time of reservation must match the name on the traveler's government issued identity or passport for both domestic and foreign travel.

          Most airlines now provide e-tickets, or electronic tickets, allowing you to travel without fear of losing or stealing your paper tickets. When traveling using e-tickets, however, make sure to bring government-issued photo identification (such as a passport or driver's license) to the airport. To travel through the security checkpoint, you must have your printed boarding pass up to 24 hours in advance. If you checked in online with your luggage or have e-tickets, you must travel to the ticket counter to get your boarding pass.

          Always double-check that the name you provide when booking matches the name on your government ID that you will use when traveling. Because boarding card systems differ, boarding passes may not always display the exact name you specified when making the reservation. However, deviations such as using a middle initial instead of a full middle name or not using a middle name/initial at all, hyphens, or apostrophes should not cause any issues for the passenger.
